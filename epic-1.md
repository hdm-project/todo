1. Simple reaction time game: Like Ping-Pong but with a simple "color-change -> click"-mechanics. Maybe show reactiontime difference. Somehow determine who wins. Implement using WebRTC p2p technology.
1. IDE and simple game control: "Whats my health?", "Drive towards the enemy", "Shoot", "Circuit around the enemy", "Drive back", "Drive away from the enemy". Loss of all life-points -> end of game.
